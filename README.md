Vanilla JavaScript Drum Kit

Day 1 in the 30 days of JavaScript by Wes Bos.

I created a short animation and sound for certain keys.

I used Keycode.info website to find the associated number for a specific key.

Audio tags contain data-key custom attribute, which connect a key with the associated sound effect.

JavaScript event listeners used in this project are keydown and transitionend.

JavaScript code was written in ES6 syntax.
